        >My name is Olivia. I've always loved taking photos, in middle and high school would do little "photo-shoots" with my friends. 
            When my son was born I decided to upgrade my camera and learned how to really use my camera well and edit my photos. 
            Soon friends were asking me to take their pictures and pictures of their kids and it's just grown since then. 
            I love capturing all the little (and big) moments for families to have forever. 
            I now do family sessions, babies and kids, couples, engagement, cake smashes, maternity, boudoir, newborns, and more. 
            If you'd like to book a session message me for further information!
